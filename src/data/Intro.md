# Mimics & Xorn
## What is this?
**Mimics & Xorn (MX)** is an attempt to focus 5e on the Exploration and Social Interaction pillars of gameplay.  The goal is to provide a more intriguing and immersive experience to those familiar with 5e.  As it stands right now, **MX** is a collection of homebrew and house rules, but the end-goal would be a self-contained and playable 5e variant.

## Why?
5e is built upon three pillars of gameplay: Exploration, Social Interaction, and Combat, but the rules and systems are almost exclusively focused on Combat.  **MX** aims to at least re-balance 5e, if not tipping the scales more toward narrative-driven Exploration and Social Interaction.

#### Why modify 5e? Why not [system]?
> ##### Sources of Inspiration
> **MX** borrows, if not blatantly steals, from the following sources:
> * Five Torches Deep
> * Index Card RPG
> * Pathfinder
> * 5e Hardcore Mode
> * Savage Worlds
> * Vampire: the Masquerade
> * Blades in the Dark

 * 5e is popular -- like it or not, 5e is the big name in RPGs.  It has name recognition, and with the resurgence of popularity, it has people who have never played an RPG asking to play it.  It does newcomers to the hobby a disservice to say, "Okay, but instead of 5e, how about we play this other game you've never heard of?"

 * 5e is accessible -- the Starter Kit is available at most big-box retailers, and the Basic Rules are available, for free.  Players can begin with 5e for cheap, if not free, and they can find 5e in the same games sections as Monopoly and Clue.

 * 5e is modular -- virtually every official 5e source provides variant rules; by design, gaming groups can pick and choose rules they want to use from the start.  The system encourages GMs to experiment with new rules and systems, and to make the game their own.

 * Finally, 5e has community -- there are websites and forums devoted to 5e, 5e-homebrew, and custom creations.  Kickstarter is full of custom settings -- including new races, classes, and even more variant rules -- and there seems no sign of slowing down.

## Current State

**MX** is currently in the "throw everything against the wall, and see what sticks" stage of development.  It's rough all the way through, just not around the edges, and some things simply might not fit in the more polished version.  In that way, it's an open and living system.
