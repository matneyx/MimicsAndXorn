# Attributes
Each character has **nine** attributes, which are separated into three categories, with each category having each a Power, Finesse, and Resistance attribute.

The three categories are: **Physical**, **Mental**, and **Social**.

> ##### Difference between MX and 5e
> In 5e, a character only has **six** attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  This works, but in our opinion, it is the core to why 5e is considered "a combat game."  When half of the attributes are physical, it's difficult for the rules to flexibly handle mental and social situations.
>
> In **MX**, Wisdom is split into both Wits and Resolve, and Charisma is split into Presence, Manipulation, and Composure.  This gives equal weight to each of the three categories.



* **Physical**
  * **Strength** (*Power*): Strength (Str) represents your character's muscle and physical power.  It impacts how much your character can carry, and how hard they can hit in hand-to-hand combat.
  * **Dexterity** (*Finesse*): Dexterity (Dex) represents your character's agility, reflexes, and balance.  It impacts how well your character can dodge (as represented by Armor Class), and how accurate they are with ranged weapons such as bows and arrows.
  * **Constitution** (*Resistance*):  Constitution (Con) represents your character's health and stamina.  It impacts your character's hit points, as well as how long they can go without needing a Short or Long rest.
* **Mental**
  * **Intelligence** (*Power*): Intelligence (Int) represents the width and depth of your character's knowledge, and their ability to remember information.  It impacts how many languages your character can know.
  * **Wits** (*Finesse*): Wits represents how well your character can think on their feet, and react quickly to a certain situation.  It also represents your character's general cleverness, how well they can put ideas together, and how well they understand cause and effect.
  * **Resolve** (*Resistance*): Resistance (Res) represents your character's strength of will and intellectual focus.
* **Social**
  * **Presence** (*Power*): Presence (Pres) represents your character's very identity, and sheer command over the attention of others.  It is the ability to impose your character's will on others through social aggression and power.
  * **Manipulation** (*Finesse*): Manipulation (Man) represents how well your character can bend others to their will, and to get others to do what your character wants through subtlety.
  * **Composure** (*Resistance*): Composure (Comp) represents your character's ability to stay focused and calm under emotional pressure, and to resist emotional manipulation.
> ##### Putting the "Roll" back in "Roleplaying"
> There is a belief among RPG players that Social challenges should be handled entirely through roleplaying, and that rules muddy the water between a game and a simulation.  Also, to a lesser extent, there is also the same belief in regards to puzzle solving, memory, and Mental challenges.
>
> However, part of playing a roleplaying game is playing characters unlike ourselves.  Sometimes, this means playing characters who are better equipped to handle situations than we are, and there's no shame in that.
>
> As this is a roleplaying game, we encourage you to attempt Mental and Social challenges with your own abilities, but when those don't feel adequate, it is absolutely acceptable to simplify a challenge to a simple (or complex) Skill roll.

## Speed, the 10th Attribute

In addition to the nine attributes listed above, characters also have a Speed attribute.  This represents a character's foot-speed -- running, walking, etc -- and not a character's reflexes or hand-speed (that would be Dexterity).

Unlike the other nine, this attribute can't be directly modified through Ability Score Increases, and should be considered more of a modifier than an actual attribute.  Speed is added to roles where a character's foot-speed would matter, such as chases and foot races.

Speed is added to your Armor Class when defending against Attacks of Opportunity.
