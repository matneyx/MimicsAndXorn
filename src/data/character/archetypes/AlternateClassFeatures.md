# Class Archetypes and Alternate Class Features
Each class in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS gains features at particular levels. Have you ever wanted an alternative to one of those features? Or do you have a feature that gives you options to choose from and you’d like more options? If
your answer is yes to either of those questions, the following class feature variants are for you.

Here you’ll find features that replace or enhance the normal features of your character’s class. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don’t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.

Also here are Class Archetypes, which a a recommended set of alternate class features that fit a theme.

The DM decides which of these options are available to the characters in a campaign. A DM is free to prohibit these variants, allow all of them, or make a subset of them available to you

#### Alternate Class Skills
Some archetypes suggest alternate class skills that better suit the archetypes.  For ease of use, all of the classes' skills will be listed, with the new skills indicated.

#### Alternate Spell Lists
Some archetypes modify the default class spell lists.  These will individually call out which spells are removed, and which are added.
