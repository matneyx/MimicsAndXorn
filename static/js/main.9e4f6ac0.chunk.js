The goal is to provide a more intriguing and immersive experience to those familiar with 5e.  As it stands right now, **MX** is a collection of homebrew and house rules, but the end-goal would be a self-contained and playable 5e variant.\n\n## Why?\n5e is built upon three pillars of gameplay: Exploration, Social Interaction, and Combat, but the rules and systems are almost exclusively focused on Combat.  **MX** aims to at least re-balance 5e, if not tipping the scales more toward narrative-driven Exploration and Social Interaction.\n\n#### Why modify 5e? Why not [system]?\n> ##### Sources of Inspiration\n> **MX** borrows, if not blatantly steals, from the following sources:\n> * Five Torches Deep\n> * Index Card RPG\n> * Pathfinder\n> * 5e Hardcore Mode\n> * Savage Worlds\n> * Vampire: the Masquerade\n> * Blades in the Dark\n\n * 5e is popular -- like it or not, 5e is the big name in RPGs.  It has name recognition, and with the resurgence of popularity, it has people who have never played an RPG asking to play it.  It does newcomers to the hobby a disservice to say, "Okay, but instead of 5e, how about we play this other game you\'ve never heard of?"\n\n * 5e is accessible -- the Starter Kit is available at most big-box retailers, and the Basic Rules are available, for free.  Players can begin with 5e for cheap, if not free, and they can find 5e in the same games sections as Monopoly and Clue.\n\n * 5e is modular -- virtually every official 5e source provides variant rules; by design, gaming groups can pick and choose rules they want to use from the start.  The system encourages GMs to experiment with new rules and systems, and to make the game their own.\n\n * Finally, 5e has community -- there are websites and forums devoted to 5e, 5e-homebrew, and custom creations.  Kickstarter is full of custom settings -- including new races, classes, and even more variant rules -- and there seems no sign of slowing down.\n\n## Current State\n\n**MX** is currently in the "throw everything against the wall, and see what sticks" stage of development.  It\'s rough all the way through, just not around the edges, and some things simply might not fit in the more polished version.  In that way, it\'s an open and living system.'},k={name:"Golarion Action Economy",key:"golarion-action-economy",data:" # Golarion Action Economy\nWhile the default turn actions are easy and predictable -- **move**, take one **action**, and maybe get a **bonus action** or **reaction** -- they also leave a lot to be desired.  Most notably, a PC who opts to stand and fight loses out on their **move** action, and gains nothing for it.\n\nIn he distant realm of Golarion, the adventurers have found a way to recover that lost action, which keeps combat moving and allows lower-level characters to feel more powerful.\n\nIn this system, a character can commit up to two (2) **actions** on their turn, in addition to any **bonus action** and/or **reaction** they may normally receive.  The character may also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, as usual,\n\n## Action Types\nThere are three types of **actions** a player can take in a turn:\n##### Simple Actions\n*Simple Actions*, such as **Move** or **Attack**, can be taken up to as many times as a player has **actions**.\n##### Complex Actions\n*Complex Actions*, such as **Disengage** or **Hide**, require a level of concentration and may only be taken alone or in the same turn as a **Move** action.  For instance, unless otherwise specified, a player may not **Hide** and **Attack** in the same turn, but they can **Hide** and **Move**.\n##### Final Actions\n*Final Actions*, such as **Ready**, immediately end a player's turn. No other **actions** may be taken, on the same turn, after a *Final Action*.  However, players may **Move** *before* a *Final Action*.\n\n#### Spells\n**Cantrips** are all considered *Simple Actions*, while all other spells are considered *Complex Actions.*  This does not reduce the casting time of spells that take longer than one turn.  Spells that cast as a **bonus action**, including spells affected by *Quickened Spell*, may still be cast as a **bonus action.**\n\nSpells cast as Spell Attacks count as unarmed *Attack Actions* for the **Multi-Attack Penalty**.\n\n>##### Multi-Attack Penalty\n> If you use an *Attack Action* more than once on the same turn, your second *Attack Action* takes a \u20135 penalty.\n>\n> Weapons with the *Light* property, and Unarmed Attacks reduce this penalty to -4.\n>\n> Any attack happening on a **bonus action** is not affected by this penalty.\n>\n> ##### Two-Weapon Fighting\n> You can only take one Bonus Action to attack with an offhand weapon.\n\n## Actions\n##### Attack (Simple)\nSee **Multi-Attack Penalty** sidebar.\n\n##### Cast a Spell (Simple or Complex)\nSee **Spells**, above.\n\n##### Dash / Move (Simple)\n\n##### Disengage (Complex)\n\n##### Dodge (Complex)\n\n##### Help (Final)\n\n##### Hide (Complex)\n\n##### Ready (Final)\n\n##### Search (Final)\n\n##### Use an Object (Complex)",homebreweryLink:"https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/print/1C1qVXiiGvutfDjl79baihNsRXxhrx6hucoEY-uyzXZu8?dialog=true"},I={name:"Archetypes and Class Features",key:"acf-link",data:"# Class Archetypes and Alternate Class Features\nEach class in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS gains features at particular levels. Have you ever wanted an alternative to one of those features? Or do you have a feature that gives you options to choose from and you\u2019d like more options? If\nyour answer is yes to either of those questions, the following class feature variants are for you.\n\nHere you\u2019ll find features that replace or enhance the normal features of your character\u2019s class. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don\u2019t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.\n\nAlso here are Class Archetypes, which a a recommended set of alternate class features that fit a theme.\n\nThe DM decides which of these options are available to the characters in a campaign. A DM is free to prohibit these variants, allow all of them, or make a subset of them available to you\n\n#### Alternate Class Skills\nSome archetypes suggest alternate class skills that better suit the archetypes.  For ease of use, all of the classes' skills will be listed, with the new skills indicated.\n\n#### Alternate Spell Lists\nSome archetypes modify the default class spell lists.  These will individually call out which spells are removed, and which are added."},B={name:"Urban Ranger",key:"urban-ranger-link",data:"# Class Archetype: Urban Ranger\nThe urban ranger stalks the treacherous streets of the city, relying on their knowledge of alleyways and underworld contacts to keep themselves alive. The urban ranger understands the streets and sewers of the city are just as dangerous as the barren wastelands or the deep forests.\n\n#### Alternate Class Skills\nChoose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, ~~Nature~~, Perception, **Persuasion**, Stealth, and Survival\n\n#### Alternate Spell List\nThe urban ranger's spell list is different from the standard ranger list. The following spells are eliminated from the urban ranger's spell list:\n\n| Level  | Spell |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| 1st Level  | *Animal Friendship, Speak with Animals* |\n| 2nd Level | *Animal Messenger, Barkskin, Locate Animals or Plants, Spike Growth* |\n| 3rd Level | *Conjure Animals, Plant Growth, Speak with Plants, Water Walk* |\n| 4th Level | *Conjure Woodland Beings* |\n| 5th Level | *Commune with Nature, Tree Stride* |\n\nIn exchange, the urban ranger adds the following spells to their class list:\n\n| Level  | Spell |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Cantrips  | *Friends, Message* |\n| 1st Level | *Charm Person, Comprehend Languages* |\n| 2nd Level | *Detect Thoughts, Hold Person, Knock, Invisibility* |\n| 3rd Level | *Dispel Magic, Glyph of Warding,Speak with Dead, Tongues* |\n| 4th Level | *Faithful Hound, Greater Invisibility* |\n| 5th Level | *Hold Monster, Mislead* |\n\n#### Recommended Alternate Class Features\n* City Explorer\n* Favored Enemy, Revised\n* Urban Awareness\n* Greater Favored Enemy, Revised\n* Favored Community\n* Push Through or Fleet of Foot\n* Blend In\n\n## Alternate Class Features\n#### City Explorer\n*1st-level ranger feature (Replaces Natural Explorer)*\n\nYou are a master of navigating the winding streets and alleyways of cities and towns, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits when inside a town or city:\n* You ignore difficult terrain.\n* You have advantage on initiative rolls.\n* On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.\n\nIn addition, you are skilled in urban navigation.  You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:\n* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.\n* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.\n* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\n* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\n* When you scrounge, forage, or dumpster-dive, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\n* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.\n\n#### Favored Enemy, Revised (Urban)\n*1st-level ranger feature (Replaces Favored Enemy)*\n\nBeginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even\ntalking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in cities and towns.\n\nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.\n\nAnother alternative, with the DM's approval, an urban ranger may select an organization instead of a creature type as his favored enemy. For example, a character might select a particular thieves' guild, merchant house, or even the city guard. The favored enemy bonuses would apply to all members of the chosen organization, regardless of their creature type or subtype.\n\nYou gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Inivestigation) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. Also, if the  Alternate Ability Skills variant rule is being used, you have advantage on Charisma (Investigation) to gather information about your chosen enemy.\n\nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.\n\n#### Urban Awareness\n*3rd-level ranger feature (Replaces Primeval Awareness)*\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the city around you.\n\nYou have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.\n\nYou cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you, or within city limits, whichever is smaller. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures\u2019 general direction and distance (in miles) from you.\n\nIf there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.\n\n#### Greater Favored Enemy, Revised (Urban)\n*6th-level ranger feature (Replaces Favored Enemy improvement)*\n\nAt 6th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Choose a second type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two more races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies, or an organization with the DM'S approval. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4.\n\nAdditionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.\n\n#### Favored Community\n*6th-level ranger reature (Replaces Natural Explorer improvement)*\n\nAt 6th level, the urban ranger forms a bond with a community. This grants you the following benefits when inside this favored community:\n* You gain a +2 on initiative rolls\n* You have advantage on Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks.\n\nAn urban ranger traveling through his favored community leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although he may leave a trail if he so desires).\n\nFor the purposes of this ability, a community is any settlement consisting of 100 or more individuals. The community may be larger than this minimum. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are not considered part of a community.\n\nThis feature may be taken again at 10th level, replacing the Natural Explorer improvement, to select another favored community.\n\n#### Fleet of Foot\n*8th-level ranger feature (Replaces Land's Stride)*\n\nBeginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.\n\n#### Push Through\n*8th-level ranger feature (Replaces Land's Stride)*\n\nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. In addition, you can move through the space occupied by local citizens as if they were allies. This does not apply to creatures intent on harming you. Areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect you.\n\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell.\n\n#### Blend In\n*10th-level ranger feature (Replaces Natural Explorer improvement)*\n\nAt 10th level, you can cast *Disguise Self* as a bonus action, when inside your favored community.  In addition to this, when a creature uses its action to discern that you are disguised, it must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) against your Dexterity (Stealth) roll instead of your spell save DC.\n\nThis does not expend a spell slot, but you cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.",homebreweryLink:"https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/print/1pfwW2vADyEwMgeHpgjxqR0IpqFpU88AA_xyoaL4ZMSO4?dialog=true"},D=[E,{name:"Character",key:"character-dropdown",data:[{name:"Class
