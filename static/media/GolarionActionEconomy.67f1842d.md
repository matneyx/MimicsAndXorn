 # Golarion Action Economy
While the default turn actions are easy and predictable -- **move**, take one **action**, and maybe get a **bonus action** or **reaction** -- they also leave a lot to be desired.  Most notably, a PC who opts to stand and fight loses out on their **move** action, and gains nothing for it.

In he distant realm of Golarion, the adventurers have found a way to recover that lost action, which keeps combat moving and allows lower-level characters to feel more powerful.

In this system, a character can commit up to two (2) **actions** on their turn, in addition to any **bonus action** and/or **reaction** they may normally receive.  The character may also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, as usual,

## Action Types
There are three types of **actions** a player can take in a turn:
##### Simple Actions
*Simple Actions*, such as **Move** or **Attack**, can be taken up to as many times as a player has **actions**.
##### Complex Actions
*Complex Actions*, such as **Disengage** or **Hide**, require a level of concentration and may only be taken alone or in the same turn as a **Move** action.  For instance, unless otherwise specified, a player may not **Hide** and **Attack** in the same turn, but they can **Hide** and **Move**.
##### Final Actions
*Final Actions*, such as **Ready**, immediately end a player's turn. No other **actions** may be taken, on the same turn, after a *Final Action*.  However, players may **Move** *before* a *Final Action*.

#### Spells
**Cantrips** are all considered *Simple Actions*, while all other spells are considered *Complex Actions.*  This does not reduce the casting time of spells that take longer than one turn.  Spells that cast as a **bonus action**, including spells affected by *Quickened Spell*, may still be cast as a **bonus action.**

Spells cast as Spell Attacks count as unarmed *Attack Actions* for the **Multi-Attack Penalty**.

>##### Multi-Attack Penalty
> If you use an *Attack Action* more than once on the same turn, your second *Attack Action* takes a â€“5 penalty.
>
> Weapons with the *Light* property, and Unarmed Attacks reduce this penalty to -4.
>
> Any attack happening on a **bonus action** is not affected by this penalty.
>
> ##### Two-Weapon Fighting
> You can only take one Bonus Action to attack with an offhand weapon.
